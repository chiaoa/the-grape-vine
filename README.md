# The Grape Vine
The Grape Vine is a web application where you can efficiently post about various plant care information, like a blog for your personal plant collection.
This helps users log tips and tricks they've discovered that they can reference when raising their plants!

## Background
### The Problem ðŸ¤”
As a plant parent, I often find myself on social media saving posts about caring for various house plants. 
While tending to my plants, I also learn how often my cactus like to be watered, how to propogate the philodendrons, and many other things a plant parent may need to know.
With so many different plants out there and their individual needs, it can be hard keeping track of how to provide optimal care to each of them. 
### The Solution ðŸ˜„
I wanted a place to quickly make note of particular methods or tips I discovered, so I created The Grape Vine. 
With an aesthetic and simple interface, The Grape Vine allows users to make a new post directly on the home page, and easily view their posts in order from most to least recent.
